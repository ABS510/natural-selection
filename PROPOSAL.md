### CS126 Final Project Proposal: Simulating Natural Selection
#### Description
Natural selection is the process whereby organisms which are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offsprings. 
I will be creating a simple environment which can be adjusted by a few parameters. 
There will be two genetic traits, speed and size, that can be passed on from one generation to the next.
Based on the environment settings, a particular combination of a speed and size would be ideal for an organism to survive. 
The program will display the simulation (most probably as circles representing organisms, which move throughout the environment) as well as a graph representing the total population as a function of time.

#### Development Timeline (Tentative)
##### Week 1: 
- A class for organisms and a class for the environment will be created and their basic functionality will be implemented.
- Using Cinder, the application can display a part of the simulation in which the organisms will able to move around the environment.

##### Week 2:
- The organisms and environment completely interact with each other.
- The major logic for the population evolution will be implemented.

##### Week 3:
- A graph of the population will be displayed.
- Extra feature may be implemented.

#### Extensions/ Extra Stuff

- More genetic traits (such as vision, stealth, etc). Difficulty depends on the genetic trait and how it changes interactions with the environment.
- Additional graphs displaying statistics for each specific genetic trait. Not too difficult to implement.
- Additional features to the environment (such as predators, decreasing food supply, etc). Difficulty depends on what feature is added to the environment.
- UI functionality like hover effects, pausing and/or speeding up the simulation using keyboard inputs. Not too difficult to implement.
