### Overview:
This project is a simulation of natural selection in a simplified environment. 
Natural selection is the process whereby organisms which are better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offsprings. 
Thus, the population of organisms evolve over generations to better survive in the environment.

In this simulation, organisms spawn on the outer edges of the environment everyday. 
Food objects are randomly scattered around the environment.
An organisms must eat a certain amount of food to survive. If an organism is unable to eat enough food to survive by the end of each day, it will perish.
Similarly, if an organism eats enough food to replicate, it will produce an offspring with traits close to its own.
This simulation also provides a line graph to keep track of the population as a function of time, as well as two histograms to show the speed and size distribution of the organisms.
